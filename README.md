# Vortex_SS
Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks containing scripts to calculate Swirling Strength
Both the .ipynb file and .py file have the same contents. Download the jupyter notebook if you wish to use the function definitions directly. Alternatively, if you would like to use the script itself as a library, 
then the python script would be a better option.
