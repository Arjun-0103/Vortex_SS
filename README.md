# Vortex_SS
Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to calculate Swirling Strength of a Vector Field (Velocity and Magnetic field in this case)

Both the .ipynb file and .py file have the same contents. Download the jupyter notebook if you wish to use the function definitions directly. Alternatively, if you would like to use the script itself as a library, 
then the python script would be a better option.
