# Vortex_SS
1)
Files_and_Variables - Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to calculate Swirling Strength (SS) of a Vector Field (Velocity and Magnetic field in this case), and other quantities like Curl and Poynting Flux.

Both the .ipynb file and .py file have the same contents. Download the jupyter notebook if you wish to use the function definitions directly. Alternatively, if you would like to use the script itself as a library, 
then the python script would be a better option.

2)
Figures_and_Analysis - Jupyter notebook containing the analysis after the calculation of SS and Poynting Flux. It is recommended to go through the Files_and_Variables notebook first, before opening this notebook.
